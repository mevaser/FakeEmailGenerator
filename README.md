Uses the Faker library to generate random usernames.
Appends @gmail.com to each username.
Automatically writes the generated emails to a text file, one address per line.

Installation & Usage
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Make sure the file createAccounts.py is in your project folder.
Install dependencies (if needed):

Once the script finishes, a file named FakedEmail.txt will be created in the same folder, containing 2,000 email addresses.
Code Explanation
python
Copy code
from faker import Faker

def main():
    fake = Faker()                       # Create a Faker object for generating fake data

    list_of_emails = []
    for i in range(2000):               # Loop to generate 2,000 email addresses
        user_part = fake.user_name()    # Get a random username (without any domain)
        custom_email = user_part + "@gmail.com"
        list_of_emails.append(custom_email)
        print(list_of_emails[i])        # Print each email address to the console

    # Save to a text file
    with open("FakedEmail.txt", "w", encoding='utf-8') as file:
        for email in list_of_emails:
            file.write(email + "\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
Faker object creation: Faker() lets us generate various random data such as usernames, names, addresses, phone numbers, and more.
Loop for email generation: Creates 2,000 email addresses, each constructed by appending "@gmail.com" to a randomly generated username.
Console output: Prints each email address to the terminal so you can see the progress.
Writing to file: The generated email addresses are written to the file FakedEmail.txt in the same folder.
Contributing
To change the number of generated addresses, simply edit the 2000 value in the loop.
