# FakeEmailGenerator

A small Python project to generate a list of fake email addresses (seeded by [Faker](https://pypi.org/project/Faker/)) ending with `@gmail.com`. By default, the script (`createAccounts.py`) generates 2,000 email addresses and saves them to `FakedEmail.txt`.

## Features
- Uses the [Faker](https://pypi.org/project/Faker/) library to generate random usernames.
- Appends `@gmail.com` to each username.
- Automatically writes the generated emails to a text file, one address per line.

---

## Prerequisites
- **Python 3.7+** (itâ€™s recommended to use a more recent version).
- The Faker library:
  ```bash
  pip install Faker
  ```

---

## Installation & Usage

1. **Clone or download** this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure the file `createAccounts.py` is in your project folder.
3. **Install dependencies** (if needed):
   ```bash
   pip install Faker
   ```
4. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python createAccounts.py
   ```
   Once the script finishes, a file named `FakedEmail.txt` will be created in the same folder, containing 2,000 email addresses.

## Code Explanation

```python
from faker import Faker

def main():
    fake = Faker()                       # Create a Faker object for generating fake data

    list_of_emails = []
    for i in range(2000):               # Loop to generate 2,000 email addresses
        user_part = fake.user_name()    # Get a random username (without any domain)
        custom_email = user_part + "@gmail.com"
        list_of_emails.append(custom_email)
        print(list_of_emails[i])        # Print each email address to the console

    # Save to a text file
    with open("FakedEmail.txt", "w", encoding='utf-8') as file:
        for email in list_of_emails:
            file.write(email + "\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

1. **Faker object creation**: `Faker()` lets us generate various random data such as usernames, names, addresses, phone numbers, and more.  
2. **Loop for email generation**: Creates 2,000 email addresses, each by appending `"@gmail.com"` to a randomly generated username.  
3. **Console output**: Prints each email address to the terminal so you can see the progress.  
4. **Writing to file**: The generated email addresses are written to `FakedEmail.txt` in the same folder.

## Contributing
- To change the number of generated addresses, simply edit the `2000` value in the loop.  
- Pull requests are welcome, whether for enhancements (e.g., using command-line arguments, supporting different domains, etc.) or bug fixes.
